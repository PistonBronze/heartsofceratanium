  WCC_CHARACTER_DR_WILY:0 "Dr. Albert Wily"
  WCC_WILY_DESC:0 "Albert Wily: Rejected from the scientific community in favour of Thomas Light's more humanistic approach to robotics, facing defeat 5 times at the hands of Light's greatest creation, Mega Man in his mission of conquering the world... he has finally done it. The whole world bends its knee to the mad doctor, with him having allies all across the globe, occupying strategic regions... but not all recognise his overlordship. A rising \"Anti-Wily Coalition\" has dedicated itself to stopping Albert from further dominating the world, and his alliance appears much... shakier than initially expected. Will Wily be able to hold through and defeat his enemies, or will he fail again, this time at the hands of the international community instead of just a robot?"
  VPP_CHARACTER_COUNCIL:0 "The Visegrad Council"
  VPP_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "The Visegrad Council is the main governing body of the Visegrad Protection Pact. Formed as haphazardly as the rest of the Pact's structure from a quick fusion of the elements of its member states' parlaments and ministries, it is probably the best representation of the entierty of the Pact: Single-issue, has a hard time with communication inside itself, and is heavily dominated by Poles. Of course, the three member states not in the majority have voiced their concerns about the situation, and reforms are supposedly on the way... one can only wait to see if this will actually be the case."

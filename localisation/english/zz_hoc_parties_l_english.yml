  emperor_scientism_desc:0 "Emperor Scientism, a term coined by the world press in the wake of Dr Wily's conquest of the world, but one he gradually grew to adopt, is a very nebulous concept. Its main tenet is the idea of a brilliant scientist ruling over a country as a sort of monarch, hence the name... and that is essentially it. Having virtually no other requirements, the concept, while tilting towards a very egotistical and cult-of-personality-esque portrayal of its leader and their achievements under Wily, could theoretically be used to define quite a few ideas of leadership. Only time will tell if more scientist empires arise in the wake of the sudden political changes around the world."
